\end{rCompany}
\begin{rCompany}{\href{http://www.rhondasoftware.com}{Rhonda Software}}{October 2012 -- May 2017}{Embedded Software Engineer}{Vladivostok}

\item Camera SDK development team member, \href{http://www.ambarella.com}{\textit{Ambarella}} SoC (ARM Cortex-A), about 80 participants.
\item Designed and implemented data transfer static library, cross-platform (Windows, Linux, ThreadX), multi-protocol (USB, UART, TCP),
      asynchronous C-style API, plain C (platform- and protocol-specific logic), C++ (transport-specific logic), build system (CMake,
      Python), CppUTest (UT infra).
\item The library was used to autotest SDK functionality in company's QA lab and to test customer's products in factory production lines.
\item Boards bringup for customer's projects in electronics factories: \href{http://www.flextronics.com}{\textit{Flextronics}} (TX, United
      States), \href{http://aqs-inc.com}{\textit{AQS}} (CA, United States), \href{http://www.asia-optical.com/}{\textit{Asia Optical}}
      (Shenzhen, China). Close coworking with local engineers (electrical, mechanical, NPI) and customers on EVT and DVT
      project phases.
\item Peripheral domain support as the member of SDK sub-team: embedded Linux and RTOS device drivers, FW burning tool features (Qt application)
      for QA lab, EE and PCB design review for customer's projects.
\item \href{http://www.csr.com}{\textit{CSR}} contractor. Distributed support of the embedded software for ODM/OEM customers based on \textit{COACH}
      (Camera On A Chip) SoC with MIPS core.
      Main brand manufacturers of imaging devices: \href{http://www.nikon.com}{\textit{Nikon}}, \href{http://www.pentax.com}{\textit{Pentax}},
      \href{http://www.garmin.com}{\textit{Garmin}}, \href{http://www.samsung.com}{\textit{Samsung}}, \href{http://www.fujifilm.com}{\textit{Fujifilm}},
      \href{http://www.abilitycorp.com.tw}{\textit{Ability}}. Support sites are located in a number of countries: China, Israel, Japan, Russia,
      South Korea, United States.
\item Solving of time critical project issues under customer's pressure. Number of various \textquote{MP block} software problems were resolved
      and processing performance of UI images in customer's projects was improved.
\item Peripheral domain support as the member of team. CMOS/CCD image sensors: drivers bug fixing and implementation of new capabilities, support
      for smear correction driver team. NV memory storages: FS bug fixing, NAND drivers timing optimizations. Display cluster: issues
      related to video output (LCD, HDMI). Volatile memory storages: DRAM performance measurement and timing optimizations. On-chip peripheral:
      support for BSP (GPIO, ADC, PWM, RTC, SPI, I2C, UART, USB, function-specific HW units and more). PC-side applied software: bug
      fixing and new features implementation for FW burning tool (windows forms). Various peripheral-specific algorithms: e.g. dynamic
      voltage management based on PID-controller.
\item SoC software trainings in \textit{CSR Israel} (formerly \textit{Zoran Corp}.): MATAM, Haifa.
