%%%%  EXPERIENCE  %%%%

\begin{rSection}{Experience}
\begin{rCompany}{\href{http://www.rhondasoftware.com}{Rhonda Software}}{October 2012 -- present}{Embedded Software Engineer}{Vladivostok, RUS}
\item Camera SDK development team member for \href{http://www.ambarella.com}{Ambarella Inc.} \textit{imaging} SoC with \textit{ARM Cortex-A} core.
\item Transport Module (TM) implementation for test framework development team in order to test SDK in automated mode. Full independent development cycle: design plan presentation (Mind Maps), architecture design (UML), coding (C, embedded C++), build system implementation (CMake, Python, BAT, Bash), unit test infrastructure bring-up (CppUTest), documentation support (Doxygen). The module is provided as cross-platform and multi-protocol core library with C-style API and asynchronous data transceiver functionality for RPC. TM transparently covers UART, USB and TCP/IP underlying protocols. The module is able to be launched on Windows, Linux and embedded HW-platform the SDK is tested on. Compilers covering: Visual Studio, GCC, MinGW and IAR.
\item Data-link layer protocol prototyping for various physical transports: UART, I2C, SPI, etc. One solution -- several transports covering. The protocol is included as part of TM and is used for customer devices communication as is.
\item Firmware burning tool support and features implementation: Qt application. Build environment is packed to \href{www.docker.com}{docker} container.
\item Review of the circuits design for customer's projects.
\item Various \textit{peripheral}-specific hardware activities. \newline
\item \href{http://www.csr.com}{CSR plc.} contractor. Work on the COACH \textit{imaging} SoC platform with \textit{MIPS} core.
\item Distributed supporting of the embedded software for ODM/OEM customers: main brand-manufacturers of imaging devices (digital still cameras, mobile driver recorders, action cameras, etc).
\item Support sites are located in a number of countries: China, Israel, Japan, Russia, South Korea, US.
\item Solving of time critical project issues under a customer's pressure. Resolved a number of various \textquotedblleft MP block\textquotedblright software and hardware problems. Improved processing performance of UI images for customer's projects.
\item \textit{Peripheral} domain support. CMOS/CCD image sensors: drivers bug fixing and implementation of new capabilities, support for smear correction driver team. NV-memory storages: file system bug-fixing, NAND drivers timing optimizations. Display cluster: issues related to video output (LCD, HDMI). Volatile-memory storages: DRAM performance measurement and timing optimizations. On-chip peripheral: support for usual BSP device driver set (GPIO, ADC, PWM, RTC, SPI, I2C, UART, USB, function-specific HW units and more). PC-side applied software: bug fixing and new features implementation for firmware burning tool (windows forms). Various peripheral-specific algorithms: e.g. dynamic voltage management based on PID-controller.
\item Business trip to CSR Israel (formerly Zoran Corp.): MATAM, Advanced Technology Center, Haifa. \newline
\end{rCompany}
\begin{rCompany}{Spider Pacific Ltd.}{October 2010 -- October 2012}{Embedded Systems Engineer}{Vladivostok, RUS}
\item Applied hardware development start-up.
\item Mechanicalless manipulator prototyping as part of the project management software system. \newline Accelerometer- and gyroscope-based console.
\item Transformerless vacuum tube stereo amplifier prototying for headphones. \newline Simple SRPP cascade and preamplifier per channel.
