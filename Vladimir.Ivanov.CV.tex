\begin{rSection}{main experience}
\begin{rCompany}{\href{http://www.rhondasoftware.com}{Rhonda Software}}{October 2012 -- present}{Embedded Software Engineer (full-time)}{Vladivostok, RU}

\item Camera SDK development team member for digital imaging products based on \href{http://www.ambarella.com}{\textit{Ambarella}} SoC.
\item Full independent development cycle of the Transport Module (TM) within SDK team: presentation of the design plan and architecture
      (Mind Maps, UML), initial implementation (plain C, C++), build system design (CMake, Python, BAT, Bash), UT infrastructure bring up
      (CppUTest), documentation support (Doxygen). The TM is used to autotest SDK functionality in QA lab via RPC and for factory acceptance
      testing of the customer's products on production lines. The module is provided as cross-platform and multi-transport library with C-style
      asynchronous API which transparently covers UART, USB and TCP/IP data exchange capabilities. The TM is integrated by application engineers
      on Windows, Linux and customer's platforms (ARM, ThreadX, embedded Linux) using wide range of supported (cross)compilers (Visual Studio,
      GCC, MinGW, IAR).
\item Data link layer protocol design and implementation for physical layers without data delivery guarantee to transparently integrate this
      capability via dedicated API (e.g. TM in case of data exchange over UART).
\item Customer's boards validations (bring up) in \href{http://www.flextronics.com}{\textit{Flextronics}} (TX, United States),
      \href{http://aqs-inc.com}{\textit{AQS}} (CA, United States) and \href{http://www.asia-optical.com/}{\textit{Asia Optical}} (Shenzhen, China)
      electronics factories. Close coworking with local engineers (electrical, mechanical, NPI) and customers on EVT and DVT
      project phases: \href{https://www.nanit.com}{\textit{Nanit}} (smart baby monitor, embedded Linux based product), \href{https://fusar.com}{\textit{Fusar}}
      (motorcycle DVR), \href{http://www.glide.me}{\textit{Glide}} (Apple Watch wristcam, rigid-flex boards), \href{https://revl.com}{\textit{Revl}}
      (action camera with motor stabilizer), \href{https://www.soloshot.com}{\textit{Soloshot}} (robotic cameraman).
\item Peripheral domain support as the member of SDK sub-team: embedded Linux and RTOS device drivers, FW burning tool features (Qt application)
      for QA lab, EE and PCB design review for customer's projects.
\item \href{http://www.csr.com}{\textit{CSR}} contractor. Distributed support of the embedded software for ODM/OEM customers based on \textit{COACH}
      (Camera On A Chip) SoC with MIPS core.
      Main brand manufacturers of imaging devices: \href{http://www.nikon.com}{\textit{Nikon}}, \href{http://www.pentax.com}{\textit{Pentax}},
      \href{http://www.garmin.com}{\textit{Garmin}}, \href{http://www.samsung.com}{\textit{Samsung}}, \href{http://www.fujifilm.com}{\textit{Fujifilm}},
      \href{http://www.abilitycorp.com.tw}{\textit{Ability}}. Support sites are located in a number of countries: China, Israel, Japan, Russia,
      South Korea, United States.
\item Solving of time critical project issues under customer's pressure. Number of various \textquote{MP block} software problems were resolved
      and processing performance of UI images in customer's projects was improved.
\item Peripheral domain support as the member of team. CMOS/CCD image sensors: drivers bug fixing and implementation of new capabilities, support
      for smear correction driver team. NV memory storages: FS bug fixing, NAND drivers timing optimizations. Display cluster: issues
      related to video output (LCD, HDMI). Volatile memory storages: DRAM performance measurement and timing optimizations. On-chip peripheral:
      support for BSP (GPIO, ADC, PWM, RTC, SPI, I2C, UART, USB, function-specific HW units and more). PC-side applied software: bug
      fixing and new features implementation for FW burning tool (windows forms). Various peripheral-specific algorithms: e.g. dynamic
      voltage management based on PID-controller.
\item SoC software trainings in \textit{CSR Israel} (formerly \textit{Zoran Corp}.): MATAM, Haifa.

\begin{rCompany}{Spider Pacific}{October 2010 -- October 2012}{Embedded Systems Engineer (full-time)}{Vladivostok, RU}

\item Applied hardware development startup company.
\item Mechanicalless manipulator prototyping as part of the project management software system: accel- and gyro-based console.
\item Transformerless vacuum tube stereo amplifier prototying for headphones: simple SRPP cascade and preamplifier per channel.
\item Prototype of the PoE injector (PSE device) designing and manufacturing. IEEE 802.3af full compatible implementation based on the LTC4263 IC by
      \href{http://www.linear.com}{\textit{Linear Technology}}. The product was used in a number of computer network projects with different
      sets of PD devices: \href{http://www.cisco.com}{\textit{Cisco}} routers, IP cameras and more.

\begin{rCompany}{\href{http://dalpribor.ru}{Dalpribor}}{May 2016 -- August 2016}{Embedded Software Consultant (contract)}{Vladivostok, RU}

\item Military avionics project of design bureau based on the \textquote{Baget} platform: VMEbus computer assembly with MIPS, DSP, ADC, RS-232
      board modules and RS-232 sensor modules which is driven by OS2000 POSIX compatible RTOS.
\item Leading developer left the company and head of bureau invited to help to cover open items which blocks initial delivery of the project to
      the customer: to solve system stuck problem after 2 hours of autonomous operation and to fix wrong initialization of new DSP boards after
      power up. First item relates to inverstigation of the toolchain, build system and code base to solve software problem. Second one -- to conversation
      with \href{http://www.insys.ru}{\textit{InSys}} company which is developer of DSP boards to check ideas.
